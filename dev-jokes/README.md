DevJokes is a sample app that lets users find, like, and share their favorite geeky jokes with other software developers. This app demonstrates how to use React hooks with an Apollo client to create jokes, filter jokes by tags, add user reactions to jokes, and moderate jokes. Also demonstrated is the client side to uploading images to AWS S3 and storing links to the images. Deploying this app on Slash GraphQL deploys both the back-end database service and a front-end React app in a single click, no credit card required.  To learn more about this sample app, see: [Building a DevJoke Application with GraphQL](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/devjoke-intro/).
